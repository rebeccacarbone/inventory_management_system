## Inventory Management System

## About
**This project is currently in progress due to a complete re-design of the project structure from working with .txt files to a relational database.** 
<br />
<br />
Upon completion, the program will allow the user, specifically the owners of The Welsh Baker in Santa Clarita, CA, to update their stock and calculate percent error in their baking productions. This is being written to help their company track when a batch underperforms, so that they can accurately test new cooking techniques and recipe changes. As an employee of the company I have determined that this is a necessary tool in order to limit wasted resources.

## Future Plans
I am currently learning to set up and work with a relational database. Once my local host is set up I will be implementing Java code to interact with the database. The program will initially have a command line interface, as the client would prefer this. I plan to create a User Interface with JavaFX once the program is fully functional.
