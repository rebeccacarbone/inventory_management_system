## Inventory Management System

## About
The Inventory Management System is a Java application that reads from and writes to .txt files representing an inventory list, with future plans to update to a database.
Once completed, the system will be used by my parents in their business's daily operations. This all-in-one program allows the inventory amounts to be easily updated and saved so that the information is accessible from anywhere. Production quantities can be calculated with a single command or set individually, and are then displayed to the user in an easy to read format. 

FILES:

- Main.java runs the system
- Test.txt is the inventory file being written to and read from
